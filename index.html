              The Israel-Hamas conflict continues to escalate. Recent Israeli
              airstrikes in southern Gaza have led to the deaths of at least 51
              people, including women and children. Humanitarian aid to the
              region is being delayed due to new restrictions by Israel,
              heightening concerns about the deteriorating situation for
              civilians in Gaza, especially with food and essential supplies
              running low.

              Children in northern Syria are enduring severe malnutrition and
              illness due to poor living conditions, rising prices, and lack of
              access to essential goods. The displacement of families and lack
              of job opportunities have exacerbated the crisis, creating a dire
              humanitarian situation in the region.

            <h3>Haiti's Gang Violence Crisis: UN Arms Embargo</h3>
            <img src="assets/news3.jpg" alt="gambar berita" />
            <span>October 22, 2024</span>
            <p>
              The United Nations Security Council has expanded an arms embargo
              to address the escalating gang violence in Haiti. Armed groups
              have taken control of much of the capital, Port-au-Prince, leading
              to clashes with local police and increasing the need for
              humanitarian aid. This move is aimed at preventing gangs from
              gaining further access to illicit weapons and worsening the
              conflict.
