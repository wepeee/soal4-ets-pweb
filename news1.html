            The Israel-Hamas conflict continues to escalate. Recent Israeli
            airstrikes in southern Gaza have led to the deaths of at least 51
            people, including women and children. Humanitarian aid to the region
            is being delayed due to new restrictions by Israel, heightening
            concerns about the deteriorating situation for civilians in Gaza,
            especially with food and essential supplies running low.
